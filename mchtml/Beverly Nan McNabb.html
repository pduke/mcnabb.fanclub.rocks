<p>
I was born on January 9, 1932, in Spearman, Hansford County, Texas. My parents were Ruth Pauline Prutsman McNabb and Warren Gilbert McNabb. I was born in my McNabb grandparents’ home while my parents were living on a farm a few miles out of town.
<p>
Some of my earliest memories are of what we always called the “old farm” in Hansford County. I remember the windmill and the water tank beside it — the water was always so cold. The land there was rolling hills. The little wooden house had never been painted and had weathered gray over the years. Inside, it was just two rooms, and the kitchen had a big wood-burning stove in the middle.
<p>
One of the very first things I remember doing as a child was tearing pages out of my grandmother’s cookbook. I don’t know why I did it — I was just playing — but that memory has always stayed with me.
<p>
I always felt safe with my mama. She was the person I felt closest to, and being near her made everything feel warm and secure, especially when the Texas winds were blowing.
<p>
Every year around Christmas, I remember one Christmas Eve in particular. My granddad, Walter Scott McNabb, and my cousin Anna Carol came to pick up me and my brother Neil. I was three years old, Neil was one, and Anna Carol was about nine and a half years older than me. My granddad had a new car — he always liked new cars. Anna Carol was driving. I sat quietly in the back seat while Neil stood on the seat, leaning over the front and jumping up and down as we drove up and down Main Street. I imagine my mother breathed a big sigh of relief when we got home safely.
<p>
That was the winter before my granddad was killed in a car accident. He and a friend were traveling dirt roads while buying and selling ranches and cattle herds when a tractor came down a side road. There were no lights on either vehicle, and they collided. My granddad and the other man in his car were killed.
<p>
Life grew harder after that.
<p>
During World War II, my father Warren got a job with the railroad, and our family moved to Winslow, Arizona. Winslow had once been a small, sleepy town, but it became busy with trains carrying soldiers and supplies.
<p>
We didn’t have electricity in our house there, so we had no radio. Every Sunday my father walked into town to buy the Denver Post, and that was how we learned about what was happening in the world. I remember when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. My father came home with the newspaper full of news about the attack, and life changed after that.
<p>
Those were the years of ration books — meat, butter, eggs, and other basics. You couldn’t buy much, but we didn’t starve. We walked most places, carried groceries home in paper sacks, and learned to make do.
<p>
As a teenager, I was quiet and shy. I had several close friends — neighbors and school friends — and some of those friendships lasted many years, long after high school, until people slowly began to pass away.
<p>
After high school, our family moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico. I went to business school for a year and then went to work. I spent many years in clerical and banking work, including working at Albuquerque National Bank.
<p>
I married and had three children. That marriage eventually ended, and the children and I lived with my parents for several years. Those were not easy years, but we managed.
<p>
Later, I married Harry Orr. He was a good man, and together we built a steady, dependable life. I worked, raised my children, and took care of what needed to be done.
<p>
What surprised me most about becoming a mother was how much work it was. I worried a lot, and I wasn’t sure how everything would turn out. The happiest memories I have are the times we went camping. Those were the most fun.
<p>
When I think about what I did best as a mother, I believe it is that my children grew up to be nice people.
<br>
<p>

When I think about what I hope people remember about me, I hope they remember that I was a kind, gentle person.
