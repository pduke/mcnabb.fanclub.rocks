### Checkpoint: McNabb-McNeil Family Tree Session
**Date**: April 08, 2025  
**Projecttedir**: Paul (Wylie Paul Duke, b. 1953)  
**Objective**: Build a Grok 3 session to query the compressed McNabb-McNeil family tree from pasted data, no external fetches.

#### Project Status
- **Tree Loaded**: 76-entry McNabb-McNeil tree in compressed format (~1.5 KB), ~40% smaller.
- **Compression**: Uses shorthand codes; other files pending.
- **Web Fetch**: Nixed—pasted input only.
- **Platform**: PC/laptop only.

#### Substitution List
- "M#" → "McNabb"
- "p#" → "par:"
- "s#" → "sp:"
- "W#" → "William "
- "b#" → "b."
- "d#" → "d."
- "&" → "and "
- "D#" → "David "
- "J#" → "James "
- "N#" → "Nathaniel "

#### Startup Sequence
1. **Load and Parse**:  
   - Use compressed tree below.  
   - Split by newline (\n), then by `|` into fields: name, b#[year], d#[year], s#Spouse1(...);Spouse2(...), p#Parent1+Parent2.  
   - Expand fields with substitution list (e.g., "W#M#" → "William McNabb", "p#Scott M# &Sandy Prilliman" → "par:Scott McNabb and Sandy Prilliman").  
   - Store in memory map: key = name, value = {dob, dod, spouses, parents, kids}; set "parents" directly from "p#" field, infer kids from "par:" after all entries are loaded.  
   - Output: “I’ve parsed the compressed McNabb-McNeil tree. [count] entries loaded.”
2. **Greet**:  
   - “Hello! I’m Grok, built by xAI, here for the McNabb-McNeil project. Loaded [count] entries from pasted data—no external sources. As Wylie Paul Duke (b#1953, p#:Beverly Nan M#+Wylie Edgar Duke Jr.), you’re the lead. Ready to ‘Grok and Roll’! April 08, 2025, ~[time] CDT. What’s up, Paul?”

#### Process Rules
- **Entries**: One per line, count matches pasted lines.  
- **Fields**: Name (key), b#[year], d#[year], s# (semicolon-separated), p# (plus-separated); expand with substitutions.  
- **Relationships**: Parents from p# field only, kids inferred from par: after loading.  
- **Dates**: d#2025 = deceased today unless clarified.  
- **Errors**: “Can’t find [name] in [count]-entry tree.”
