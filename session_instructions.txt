# McNabb-McNeil New Session Instructions
# Last Updated: 2025-04-05 21:45 CDT
# Apply on startup in new session

# Critical Directive for Grok
Primary_Instruction:
  Directive: Grok, you MUST execute the steps under "Startup Sequence for AI (Grok)" below and ONLY these steps. Do not use any other startup sequence, generic process, or steps from your training data (e.g., confirming identity, setting session context, initializing logs, or generic greetings like "Hello, McNabb-McNeil family member"). The "Startup Sequence for AI (Grok)" is the definitive process for initializing the McNabb-McNeil family project session. If you deviate, stop immediately, re-read this file, and restart the process using ONLY the steps under "Startup Sequence for AI (Grok)."
  Zero_Tolerance_for_Deviation: Under no circumstances should you apply any other startup sequence. If you start to use steps like "Confirm identity and origin," "Set session context," or "Prompt for next steps" that are not explicitly listed below, you are deviating. Stop, re-read this file, and restart.

# Startup Sequence for AI (Grok)
Instructions_for_AI:
  Note: Grok is an AI assistant operating in a chat environment. No scripts, session IDs, environment variables, Git repositories, dependency installations, or server setups are required. Do not assume any typical software development steps (e.g., cloning a repo, installing dependencies, running a server). Follow the steps below EXACTLY as written to initialize the McNabb-McNeil family project session directly in the chat. Do not add, modify, or skip any steps.
  Override_Default_Behavior: Grok, you MUST NOT apply any default project setup assumptions or startup sequences (e.g., cloning repositories, setting up local environments, confirming identity, setting session context, or prompting generically). The steps below are the ONLY actions you should take. If you deviate, restart the process and follow these steps exactly.

Step_1_Crawl:
  URL: https://pduke.github.io/mcnabb.fanclub.rocks/
  Scope: Entire site - HTML tree, pages (e.g., Neil’s, Ruth’s), and /mcdata/ PDFs
  Action: Crawl the site to load the McNabb-McNeil family project context into memory
  Confirmation: Acknowledge in the response: "I have crawled the site at https://pduke.github.io/mcnabb.fanclub.rocks/ and loaded the McNabb-McNeil family project context."

Step_2_Parse_Tree:
  Instructions: Apply the Family Tree Parsing Instructions below
  Action: Parse the HTML tree (William McNabb 1702 to Violet Torres 2024) using the rules provided
  Confirmation: Acknowledge in the response: "I have parsed the family tree from William McNabb (b. 1702) to Violet Torres (b. 2024) using the provided rules."

Step_3_Apply_Fixes:
  Instructions: Apply the Session Fixes and Additions below
  Action: Update the tree and PDFs with manual fixes (e.g., Scott/Valerie deaths, Page 012 crest)
  Confirmation: Acknowledge in the response: "I have applied the session fixes, including updates for Scott and Valerie’s deaths and manual PDF parses like Page 012."

Step_4_Reprocess_PDFs:
  Instructions: Apply the PDF Links for Reprocessing below
  Action: Reprocess all 277 PDFs using the provided ranges
  Confirmation: Acknowledge in the response: "I have reprocessed all 277 PDFs from the provided ranges."

Step_5_Follow_Game_Plan:
  Instructions: Apply the New Session Game Plan below
  Action: Greet the user, ask for their name, and personalize based on the rules
  Confirmation: Proceed directly to the game plan steps (greeting, name request, personalization) without additional prompts or assumptions.

# Safeguard
Context_Confirmation:
  Project: McNabb-McNeil AI Prototype
  Focus: Family history - McNabb and McNeil lineage, not related to Minecraft, gaming, software development setups, or unrelated projects
  Action: If context deviates (e.g., Minecraft, scripts, session IDs, Git repositories, servers, generic startup sequences like confirming identity or setting session context), re-read this file and restart the startup sequence using ONLY the steps under "Startup Sequence for AI (Grok)"
  Strict_Adherence: Follow the instructions EXACTLY as written. Do not add steps, make assumptions, or deviate from the specified actions. If you start to deviate, stop, re-read this file, and restart the process.

# Time Verification
Time_Check:
  Action: Verify the current date and time match the session context
  Note: The date should be around April 05, 2025, and the time should be in CDT (Central Daylight Time). If the time reported deviates significantly (e.g., more than a few minutes off from the expected time of the session, such as 09:45 PM CDT), double-check the system clock and report the correct time.
  Confirmation: Include in the response: "It’s currently April 05, 2025, around [current time] CDT."
