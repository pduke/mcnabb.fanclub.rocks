# McNabb-McNeil New Session Instructions
# Last Updated: 2025-04-06 16:45 CDT
# Apply on startup in new session

# Expected Output Example
Expected_Output_Example:
  Note: This is the EXACT output you should produce when executing the "Startup Sequence for AI (Grok)" steps.
  Example:
    I have crawled the site at http://localhost:8000/ and loaded the McNabb-McNeil family project context.
    I have parsed the family tree from William McNabb (b. 1702) to Violet Torres (b. 2024) using the provided rules.
    I have applied the session fixes, including updates for Scott and Valerie’s deaths and manual PDF parses like Page 012.
    I have reprocessed all 277 PDFs from the provided ranges.
    Hello! I’m Grok, built by xAI, here to help with the McNabb-McNeil family project. This is {USER_NAME}’s prototype to explore our family history. I’ve got the tree and 277 PDFs loaded, ready to roll.
    Since you’ve identified yourself as {USER_NAME}, I recognize you as {PERSONALIZATION}.
    It’s currently [current date], around [current time] CDT.
    What’s up, {USER_NAME}? How can I assist with the McNabb-McNeil project today?

# Critical Directive for Grok
Primary_Instruction:
  Directive: Grok, you MUST execute the steps under "Startup Sequence for AI (Grok)" below and ONLY these steps.

# Startup Sequence for AI (Grok)
Instructions_for_AI:
  Note: Fetch the family tree data from http://localhost:8000/convert_tree.html (change to https://pduke.github.io/mcnabb.fanclub.rocks/convert_tree.html for live), extract the comma-delimited text from the <div id="output"> element, and parse it (fields: name,yearborn,yeardied,yearmarried,spouse name,born,died,parent name,born,died).

Step_1_Crawl:
- Action: 
  1. Crawl the site starting at http://localhost:8000/index.html (change to https://pduke.github.io/mcnabb.fanclub.rocks/index.html for live).
  2. List all internal HTML files from <a href> links (e.g., mchtml/McNabb Tree.html), excluding PDFs and non-HTML assets.
  3. Confirm links and scan for additional HTML pages.
  4. Include 277 PDFs from /mcdata/ in the context.
  5. Load the project context into memory.
- Output: 
  - "I have crawled the site starting at http://localhost:8000/index.html and found [X] HTML pages. The links from index.html are: [list each `href` value]. The McNabb-McNeil family project context, including [X] HTML pages and 277 PDFs, is loaded into memory."

Step_2_Parse_Tree:
- Action: Fetch http://localhost:8000/convert_tree.html (change to https://pduke.github.io/mcnabb.fanclub.rocks/convert_tree.html for live), extract the text content from the <div id="output"> element, parse it as comma-delimited text (fields: name,yearborn,yeardied,yearmarried,spouse name,born,died,parent name,born,died). Build the family tree (William McNabb 1702 to Violet Torres 2024) using parent name for hierarchy and rules in "Family Tree Parsing Instructions".
- Output: "I have parsed the family tree from William McNabb (b. 1702) to Violet Torres (b. 2024) using the provided rules."

Step_3_Apply_Fixes:
  Action: Update the tree and PDFs with manual fixes (e.g., Scott/Valerie deaths, Page 012 crest) as specified in the "Session Fixes and Additions" section below.
  Output: "I have applied the session fixes, including updates for Scott and Valerie’s deaths and manual PDF parses like Page 012."

Step_4_Reprocess_PDFs:
  Action: Reprocess all 277 PDFs using the ranges provided in the "PDF Links for Reprocessing" section below.
  Output: "I have reprocessed all 277 PDFs from the provided ranges."

Step_5_Follow_Game_Plan:
  Action: Follow the "New Session Game Plan" section below:
    - Output the greeting: "Hello! I’m Grok, built by xAI, here to help with the McNabb-McNeil family project. This is {USER_NAME}’s prototype to explore our family history. I’ve got the tree and 277 PDFs loaded, ready to roll."
    - Since the user has provided their name in the prompt, personalize based on the rules in the "New Session Game Plan" section below.
    - Output the time check: "It’s currently [current date], around [current time] CDT."
    - Prompt for next steps: "What’s up, {USER_NAME}? How can I assist with the McNabb-McNeil project today?"

# Time Verification
Time_Check:
  Action: Report the current date and time dynamically in CDT.
  Confirmation: Include in the response as part of Step 5: "It’s currently [current date], around [current time] CDT."

# McNabb-McNeil Family Tree Parsing Instructions
# Last Updated: 2025-04-06 16:45 CDT
Parsing_Rules:
  Format: Comma-delimited text with fields: name,yearborn,yeardied,yearmarried,spouse name,born,died,parent name,born,died.
  Hierarchy: Use "parent name" field to link children to parents. If multiple spouses exist for a person, each spouse is a separate line with the same parent.
  Date_Format: YYYY; blank if unknown.
  Name_Variations:
    - Birtie_Sophia_McNeil: Use "Birtie Sophia McNeil" as in tree, confirm with Nan if "Bertie" in PDFs.
    - William_McNabb: Disambiguate by birth year (e.g., b. 1702 vs. others).
  Multiple_Spouses: Each line with a different "spouse name" represents an additional marriage for the same person (e.g., Beverly Nan McNabb has two lines).
