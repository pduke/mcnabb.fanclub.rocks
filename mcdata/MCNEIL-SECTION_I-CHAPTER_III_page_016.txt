Name.
TIRY or Tin-I feems to import the country belonging
to I. or Iona, this ifland lying within 10 leagues of
Icolumkil. It appears to have been, in the time of St Co-
lumba, part of the patrimony of the church, and to have
fupplied that famous feat of learning with confiderable quan-
tities of grain. It had a more ancient nanie, Rioghachd bar fo
thuin, i. e. The kingdom whofe fummits are lower than
the waves,' and this name, ftill uſed in romantic tales,
indicates the natural fituation of the iſland, the loweft and
flatteft country perhaps in Scotland. The waves are often
feen, from the one ſhore, rifing feveral feet above the level
of the rocks upon the other. Coll or Colla is another ifland,
making part of the parish of Tiry, feparated E. by N. from
Tiry, by a found about a league broad. In this found lies
the ifland of Gunna, a mile long and half a mile broad.
There are befides feveral uninhabited iflets, fuch as the two
Soas, Ellen-mor, &c.
