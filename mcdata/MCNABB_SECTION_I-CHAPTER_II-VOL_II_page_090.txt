NOW WE KNOW ABOUT BABTISTE,
OR BABTIST, OR BABTIS, etc.
by Walter Craig Davidson,
I quote from page 146 of the HISTORY OF THE KUYKENDALL FAMILY,
by George Benson Kuykendall, M.D., Kilham Co., Portland, Oregon,
1919, as follows:
"The Van Auken family, who lived in the Machackemeck section of
the Minisink country, and across the Delaware below in Pennsyl-
vania, came from Marinus Van Aken and Pieternella des Prez. The
name Van Auken looks in the present form to be Dutch, but is most
surely of French origin. It came from the old city of Aachen in
France, commonly called Aux la Chapelle, from where the ancestors
of the family came. The Dutch Van must have been substituted for
the French equivalent, after the family went to the Esopus settle-
ments, where the inhabitants all spoke Dutch....The Van Aukens were
prominent people in the valley of the Hudson and Delaware."
