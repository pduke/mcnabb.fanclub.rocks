Dear Mr. Davidson:
This is a response to your letter of February 1.
We examined the indexes to all the various Draper finding aids and found
only one reference to a William McNabb. This reference is to a receipt
in a military receipt book kept by William Preston of Augusta County,
Virginia. In this volume members of Preston's company of Augusta County
Rangers entered receipts for pay, provisions, and other services.
description of the McNabb receipt is attached. It goes on to say that
the receipt is for pay for the months of March, April and four days in
May. [1759]
Sincerely,
Harent. Melle,
Harold L. Miller
