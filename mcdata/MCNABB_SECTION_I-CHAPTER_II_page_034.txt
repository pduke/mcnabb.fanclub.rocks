Walter Scott McNabb was in the real estate business, throughout the
Southwest, from 1902 until his death in an automobile accident, in
the vicinity of Hereford, Texas, in 1936. He also brought in several
oil wells near Brackenridge, Texas. He helped to establish several
towns in the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandle by bringing in train-cars
full of purchasers, from not only the Eastern United States but from
Canada as well. At these sales, entire townships would be sold, lot by
lot, at auction for cash or letter of credit.
