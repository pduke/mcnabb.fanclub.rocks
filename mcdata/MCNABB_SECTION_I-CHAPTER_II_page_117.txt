* Where the spelling as Minet came from I do not know; however,
all the original family documents show the family name to be
spelled Mynatt.
Following are the directions for locating the Minet Cemetery:
Take County Road 100 NWest from Riceville, or from the intersection
of 1-75 and CR 100, to CR 82, which is about 4½ miles. Then take
CR 82 SEast until CR 82 turns to the NWest at the intersection of
CR 82 and CR 59, which is about 1½ miles. Then take CR 59 to the
very first road to the West. That is, to your right, and is about
400 yards from the intersection. It is CR 53 on which you travel about
another 400 yards and at the slight bend to the left of the Road,
on your right is the Minet (Mynatt) Family Cemetery.
In November 1995, Walter Craig Davidson had a new tombstone placed
on the grave of his fifth great grandmother, Elizabeth Taylor McNabb.
The old marker had been placed there in 1861 or 62, after the death
of James McNabb, son of Elizabeth Taylor McNabb & David McNabb. In his
will, James left a sum of money and instructions to place a stone
marker on his mother's grave. That stone had served well for over a
hundred and thirty years; however, time and the elements had rendered
it virtually impossible to read and in another few years all information
on it would have been lost. One would hope that in another two or
three hundred years someone will replace this one.
