crushing defeat at Worcester on 3 September
1651, John survived the battle but died not long
afterwards, killed by marauding members of the

army.
The castle of Eilan Ran was burnt by the
English in 1654. Smooth John's widow married
Malcolm MacGregor and took the lands of
Ewer in exchange for Kinnell, which became the
seat of the family. Robert, 14th Chief, refused to
rise for the Stuarts in 1715, but many of the
Clan did.
John, 15th Chief, was a major in the English
army and was taken prisoner at Prestonpans on
21 September 1745. Some of the Clan sup-
ported the Rising,, but most felt that after
Worcester they had doneenough for the Stuarts
and had received little thanks for their efforts.
John's brother-in-law Francis Buchanan ac
companied Prince Charlie to the last, and re-
ceived his ruby ring and a sword. The ring was
subsequently presented to the National Museum
in Edinburgh by Miss Sarah Anne Macnab of
Macnab, 18th Chief. The sword went with her
father" Archibald, 17th Chief, to Canada, was
bought by Donald, brother of James William,
the 19th Chief, and is in family hands.
Francis, 16th Chief (1734-1814) is the best
known Macnab because of the famous portrait
of him by Raeburn. He was a man large of body
and of appetites. He lived to the end like an old-
fashioned chief at Kinnell House, and died,
35,000 pounds in debt."
Francis left the Macnab lands to his nephew,
Archibald (17th Chief), but the lands were
hopelessly encumbered and Archibald could do
nothing to save them. Some of the land was sold
off but no buyer could be found for the re-
mainder. In 1823 a writ of foreclosure was is-
sued. Archibald fled to Canada, where he ob-
tained a grant of 81,000 acres in the Ottawa
River Valley. He was followed in 1825 by 500
men, women, and children of the Clan. By
1838 he was unsuccessful in his dream of re-
establishing the family fortune and repurchasing
ancestral lands. He finally left Canada in 1853,
moved about, and died in 1860 at Lanion,

The succession to the chiefship was left in
doubt after Sarah Anne's death. The Lord Lyon
finally recognized James William Macnabb, of
the Macnabbs of Arthurstone, as 19th Chief. He
was succeeded on his death in 1915 by his son,
the Rev. James Frederick, 20th Chief, for many
years rector of Bolton Abbey, Yorkshire.
James Alexander Macnabb, OBE, ID, 21st
Chief, was educated at Eton and Cambridge. He
was famous in rowing airdes, winning a Bhse at
Cambridge and a Gold Medal at the Paris
Olympic Games. He served in WW II in the
Royal Artillery in West Africa and Burma,
reaching the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
In 1949, Archibald Corrie Macnabb, son of
James Frederick, 20th Chief, bought back Kin-
nell House and 7,000 acres from the Brea-
dalbane Estate. In 1954 James Alexander sur-
rendered his claim to the succession in favor of
his uncle, and Archibald Comie was recognized
by the Lord Ly an as 22nd Chief.

the Clan in perpetuity, and as a burial place for
