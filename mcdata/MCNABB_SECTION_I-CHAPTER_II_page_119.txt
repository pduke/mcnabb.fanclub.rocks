Carolina(now Tenn). She was the daughter of Baptist McNabb, Sr., and the
sister of David McNabb, b. 22 Feb. 1755 in Augusta Cty., Virginia d.13 May 1826.
David McNabb, son of Baptist McNabb, Sr., married Elizabeth Taylor in 1778,
in Augusta Cty., Virginia. Elizabeth Taylor was the daughter of Andrew
Taylor I, and the sister of Andrew Taylor II. She was born in Augusta Cty.,
Virginia in 1757(60) and died in McMinn Cty., Tenn. on June 20, 1848. She
is buried in MYN ATT Cemetery McMinn Cty., Tenn. She and David had. 13
children--3 daughters and 10 sons--Four of the sons had 'Taylor' in their
names. For example, Nathaniel Taylor McNabb b. 5 Feb 1783. They lived
all of their married lives in Washington County, N.C., until 1796, when Tenn
became a state and Carter County was organized from part of Washington County.
After David's death in 1826, Elizabeth moved to McMinn Cty, Tenn from Carter
County, Tenn. She received Pension #W7438, as a widow of a Revolutionary War
veteran. David was appointed to the committee, by the Tenn Assembly, to locate
a site for the county seat of Carter County, in 1796-97. The site was
determined and named Elizabethton. Landon Carter, another committee member,
also had a wife named Elizabeth--so it is a shared honour. Elizabethton is
still(1989) the county seat of Carter County, where David died 13 May 1826.
