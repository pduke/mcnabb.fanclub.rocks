William McNabb received a 300 acre land grant in Feb. 1749. He arrived in the
area circa 1737, with his children Baptist, John, Samuel, Betty, James and,
possibly, Andrew. Some accounts : include William and David also but these
appear unlikely to have been William's sons, by his first wife; possibly by the 2nd
527
wifs.
