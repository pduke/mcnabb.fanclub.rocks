Back-Country Victory
harles Cornwallis, given command in the South,
in South Carolina in the spring of 1780. Then, on
August 16, he tightened his grip on the state at
Camden by routing Horatio Gates and a makeshift
army of Rebel militia, who "ran like a Torrent and
bore all before them." Alexander Hamilton com-
mented acidly that Gates' precipitous flight did
"admirable credit to the activity of a man at his
time of life."
Planning to expand his operations northward,
Cornwallis sent his left wing, a Tory force under
Patrick Ferguson, to sweep the interior of the Caro-
linas. On October 7 it was attacked at King's
Mountain by what Ferguson called "back water
men. . . a set of mongrels" under Isaac Shelby and
John Sevier. The rugged pioneers killed Ferguson
and knocked out eighty per cent of his command, a
crushing defeat which disabused Cornwallis of any
ideas of taking North Carolina in 1780.
The "over-mountain men" from the Watauga settlements rendez-
voused at Sycamore Flats (above) before marching on the Tory
force at King's Mountain. The Tories fired too high at the at-
tackers charging up the hillside (below) and were overwhelmed.
