BAPTISTE MCNABB, SENIOR, DID NOT HAVE A SON NAMED WILLIAM

Junior; William McNabb, Junior, father of Baptiste McNabb, Senior,
Baptiste McNabb, Senior (b.ca 1720 d. Jan 4, 1784, Washington

McNabb did not have a son named William, can be found in the
ABSTRACTS of WILLS for Washington County, Tennessee. William
is not mentioned as a son but is shown as a Teste: to the Will.
