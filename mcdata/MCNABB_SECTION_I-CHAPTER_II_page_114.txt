Bell View Mausoleum. Their son, Walter Craig Davidson, was born
in Hutchinson, Kansas on 7 March 1920. He married Doris Louise
Buckner* born 21 May 1921, in Leaksville, now Eden, NC, on 1 Mar 1945.
On 1 Sept 1947 their son Wm. Craig Davidson was born in Amarillo,
Texas. In a direct line Wm. Craig Davidson (and counting the generation
in which David and Elizabeth Taylor McNabb lived as number one) is
the 8th generation or said another way, Elizabeth Taylor McNabb is
William Craig Davidsons great-great-great-great-great-great-grand
mother.
It was Elizabeth Taylor McNabb's fifth great grand son who had the
new grave monument installed. This was done to replace the one that
had been put there in 1862 after the death of James McNabb, the son
of Elizabeth Taylor McNabb, who had left instructions in his will
for a stone marker to be put on his mother's grave. That marker had
served its purpose very well but time and the elements had taken such
a toll on it that it could no longer be read. So it was time for
a new one. And a hundred years or so down the road perhaps, another
descendent will have another new and legible one installed.
That fifth great grand son is:
