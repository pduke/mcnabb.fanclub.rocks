ing to her the express right, power and authority to execute and
deliver any and all oil, gas and other mineral leases and other in-

SEVENTH. Should my daughter, Vibla Whitson, elect not to serve
as my executrix, pre-decease me, die before qualifying hereunder or
while acting as my executrix, or for any reason be unable to act, then
P. A. Lyon shall be executor in her place. He shall have the same
rights, duties, power and authority as if he had been originally named
as executor in this will in place of my said daughter.
No bond or
other security shall be taken or required of him and no other action
shall be had in the Probate Court in relation to the settlement of my
estate than the probating and recording of my will and the return into
court of an inventory, appraisement and list of claims of my estate.
This I make and publish as my last will and testament, hereunto
signing and subscribing my name this the 5th day of August, 1955, in
the presence of the undersigned, who attest the same at my request.
