CLAN BURIAL GROUND-INCHBUIE
The Island of Inchbuie is reached through an iron gate where the middle of the
Dochart Bridge rests on the western tip of the Island. Opposite, to the west is the
picturesque island of Garbh-Innis round which the waters of the Dochart come
dashing down in a series of small cascades. The gate opens on to steps near which
are two stone pillars like those leading to Kinnell House. The old accounts speak of
two immense dragons crouched on the top of these. Possibly these were the lions
now on top of the last pair of pillars leading to Kinnell House. Beyond the pillars
is a stone wall with three open arches. The island slopes steeply on all sides to
the river which has cut a deep cleft through the rocky strata. It is divided into three
sections by, firstly, an earthen ridge, and secondly, about 150 yards further on, an
ancient stone wall. The whole island is about 350 yards long, and is covered with
Scots pines, larches, beeches and sycamores. In the middle, lay an old iron fireplace,
reputed to have come from Kinnell House. It has since disappeared. Beyond the
stone wall lies the burial ground with a square stone enclosure, open to the sky and
guarded by a massive iron gate.
