Black River lore has it that Sophia carried Hugh 2 the 20 miles to town to
have him baptised and then carried him home again. Baptism was probably
at St. Peters. Hugh was an early farmer. According to the Saint John
"Globe" Hugh was the first settler to bring in horses and wagons to the
area, to replace the oxen then in use. From "Globe" newspaper:
