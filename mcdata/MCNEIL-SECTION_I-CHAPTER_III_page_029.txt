SCHOOLING AND FORMAL EDUCATION

INTELLECTUAL COMPETITION
Based on an individual's sensitivity to and concernment for the qualitative
intensification and extensiveness of his own awareness and formed by a
configuration of learning through training, conceptualization, and realization,
legally approved schools and formal educational institutions are the systematic
moral commitments of society by which the student is presented with an
opportunity for conscious involvement with the ever-flowing content and
controvertible structure of the varied areas of study that serve to enable the
less mature not only to attend rationally to the composition of himself by the
attainment of:
Vocational proficiency and social participation competency inculcated by
the training process that is inherent in the nature of schooling;
Self-affirmation, self-acceptance and societal confidence through the initial
formal educational areas of the behavioral, biological and social sciences;
Ego transcendence and social responsibility by virtue of the influence of
both the Humanities and a cognizance of the universality of those personal
values held dear by all varieties of mankind as made evident by the content
of the mass communication media (a content which is at once a propagator
and a resultant of the confluent cultural drift of the world's societies);
and
A sound critical appraisal of both the relatively immediate and the
consequent effects on society and thus on himself of not only scientific,
engineering, and technological exertion, per se, but, prior to other than
experimental and delimited implementation, the often irremediable results
thereof;
but formal education also serves to enable the student, in his cognitive, and
often non-rational, efforts to make self-purpose, self-expression, and
experience comprehensible to the mind, consciously to construct and to enlarge
upon a conversationally justifiable philosophy of life and of death%; a philosophy
that performs the dual function of having not only a rather immediate
psychologically sophisticating and sociologically empathetic effect on the
embryonic personality gestalt of the individual but also engenders the somewhat
more difficult and more time-consuming process of producing, from the attitudinal
dimension of his own moral responsibility and authority, non-fearful humor, and
volitional self-transformation, a humane, fundamental integrity and a passionate,
humanistic social sensitivity and sensibility, as he earns additional maturity.
