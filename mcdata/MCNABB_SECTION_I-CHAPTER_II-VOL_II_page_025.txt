Fathers, brothers, cousins, uncles and others could sign as
a witness, but not sons & daughters. It was a custom so
strongly enforced, that in the forty-five years that I have
been assiduously researching the McNabbs (and seven other
families), I have not yet found an exception.
In the 1770's, shortly after William, Baptiste and Baptiste's
family moved from Augusta County, Virginia to Washington County,
NC/Tenn., Baptiste McNabb, Senior, built the first grist mill in
Tennessee. Shortly thereafter, William McNabb, Junior, was elected
to the Washington County, NC/Tenn Court system. It does not seem
likely that the local citizens would have supported such an election,
if the person so elected was in his late teens or early twenties.
Which would have been the case, if there had been a son of Baptiste
named William. Rather, such an election is understandable if the
person, even one relatively new to the area, was of some maturity
and probably had been well known elsewhere---in this case Augusta
County, Virginia, whence many of these local to Washington County,
NC/Tenn., people came.
An early McNabb family researcher, Daniel T. Brennan, shows William
McNabb, Junior, as having died in Wautauga (h) County, NC/Tenn in
1784, which is now in North Carolina. Another account has him dying
in what is now Carter Co., Tenn., and being buried in the "Watauga
Old Fields", which is another name for the fields where crops were
grown by the native Indian tribes.
Like so much of our clan history, more research needs to be done
and without a lucky break, here and there, we will never quite
finish; however, at least we know that Baptiste McNabb, Senior,
did not have a son named William.
