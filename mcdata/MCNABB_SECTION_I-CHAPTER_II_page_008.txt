SCOTTISH CREST BADGES
1. 1
The Last Word
Much confusion exists about the meaning,
use and entitlement to wear Scottish crest badg-
es, and it is constantly increased by well-
meaning but ill-iunformed explanations. These
notes are authoritative in setting out the main
facts. Even the popular name "can crest" is a
misnomer, as there is no such thing as a "clan"
crest. The crest is the exclusive personal property
of the clan chief, and it is fully protected to him
by the laws of Scotland. The circumstances in
which it may be worn by his clansmen are set
* out hereafter

The Crest
When a coat of arms is granted by the Sove-
reign through Her Majesty's Lord Lyon King of
Arms, the grant of arms document shows the

coat of arms on a shield. Above
the shield is placed a conventional
helmet, and on top of the helmet
is shown an additional device
I called the CREST, accompanied
by the owner's motto on a con-
ventional scroll. It is impossible
to own a crest without first own-
ing a grant of arms, as the crest is
an adjunct to the coat of arms.
Sometimes an additional mot-
to is granted which may correctly
appear on the clansman's bonnet
badge as an alternative to the first
motto,
The Weath
Between the crest and the helmet usually ap-
pears a WREATH of twisted cloth of alternate
twistsof the owner's livery colors, on which the
wreath stands. When the crest is shown by itself
without the coat of arms this wreath is always
shown beneath it to indicate that it is a heraldic
a crest and not merely a depiction of one object or
other. It is usually shown as a "lort" of straight
sausage with six twists.
Rights
Any Soot who has recorded arms and crest in
the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in
Scotland ("Lyon Register") has the right to wear
his crest as a badge in various particular forms.
No one else at all may wear a badge of the
crest that such an armiger (one legally entitled to
arms) has recorded as his own, and this is a mat-
ter of law
The arms and crest are protected by their
owner by the Laws of Arms in Scotland, and in-
fringement of his sole rights can bring prosecu-
tion, a fine, and confiscation of the
propewit y
marked with the rightful owner's crest. [This is
not the case in England or Wales, ed.] Such pros-
ecution is conducted entirely at the expense of
the Crown, so the owners of arms can invoke it
freely and at no cost to themselves.
In Scotland all arms and crests are personal.
There is no such thing as a "Family coat of arms
or crest." Though the arms or crest may be
borne by successive members of a family they
are personal to each in turn (and must be ma-
triculated by each inheritor]. The rules of in-
heritance of arms and crests are strict.
WEARING AND FORM OF CREST BADG-
ES
Chiefs of clans: Chiefs have the right to wear
their crests as badges either without the ac-
companiment of airdet, motto, or feathers be-
hind the badge, or as is more usual, surrounded
by a plain circlet inscribed with his motto or slo-

gan. He may wear
three eagle feathers in
silver behind the circ
let.
If the chief is also a
peer he may add his
coronet of rank on top
of the circlet.
Chieftains: Heads of
large branches of a
clan, officially rec-
ognized as such by the
Lord Lyon, may wear
either their own per-
sonal crest within a
plain airdet inscribed
with the motto, as for a chief, but with two
