Dear Mr. Davidson:
Replying to your request for information concerning the origin,
history, and tartan of the MacNab Clan of Scotland, I give you the
following material from "Scottish Clans and Their Tartans," by the
Duke of Montrose, published by W. and A. K. Johnston, Ltd., of
Edinburgh and London, page 67.

"The MacNabs are of ecclesiastical origin. They are called in
Gaelic Clann-an-Aba' - Children of the Abbot and are descended
from the abbots of Glendochart. The The clan possessions were sitat-
ed on the side of Loch Tay and stretched along the course of the
Dochart to the head of Strathallan. The MacNabs prospered until the
reign of Alexander III., when they were acknowledged to have been a
powerful and influential family. Unfortunately for themselves they
elected in 1306 to support the Comyn interests, and assisted the
MacDougalls and MacNaughtons to defeat the Bruce at Dalrigh.
years later King Robert reversed the defeat, when he overthrew the
MacDougalls and MacNabs in a fierce battle in the Pass of Brander.
The two clans were not subdued by that disaster, for in 1314 they and
their allies, the Comyns, appeared under the English standard at
Bannockburn. During these wars the lands of the MacNabs were over-
run by their enemies, their houses were destroyed, and their family
papers lost or stolen 3B and after Bannockburn their estates were
forfeited and were granted by the Bruce to his loyal supporters
MacGregors, the Dewars, Menzieses, and certain religious establish-
ments. Thus their family history has no continuity until the time of
Gilbert MacNab, who made his peace with King David II., and obtained
from that monarch a charter for the barony of Bovain, in Glenshart in
1336. Gilbert is usually styled the first chef of the clan. He
died in the reign of Robert II., and was succeeded by his son, Finlay
(II.), who lived in the reigns of Robert II. and Robert III., and
died in the reign of King James I. At this time the MacNabs had a
feud with the MacGregors. The two clans had a savage but drawn encour-
ter near Crianlartch in 1426 and so reduced were they that Duncan
Campbell of Glenprchy, considering himself capable of disposing of
them, obtained the royal consent to punish them. He disposseed the
MacGregors of certain lands; but the MacNabs beat him off and even-
tually they and the MacGregors combined against him. Finlay was
succeeded by his son, Patrick III., and obtained charters for Auchlyne
in 1464 and 1474, who resigned his lands to his son, Finlay, in 1487.
Finlay (IV.) is said to have been a gaelic bard. He obtained a charter
