The Tiry-man above 100, was allowed to be 106, at his
death, in fpring laft. Except for the laft 7 years he ſupport-
ed himſelf and wife by herding. His livelinefs appeared to
the laft, not only by walking but dancing. There are no re-
gifters of births or burials, and the parish records preceeding
the prefent incumbent's time have been loft.
There are not 40 natives of any other parish in the two
ifles. Tradefmen are numerous, yet fome good ones are
much wanted. It is not eafy to calculate their number, be-
caufe, in general, they are not diftinct from farmers. Many
men and women work at the weaving buſineſs. There are
very few batchelors or widowers. The men frequently mar-
ry at 19 or 20. The population has been alfo increaſed,
within thefe 14 years, by three fuccefsful courfes of inocula-
tion.
The fituation of the parish is difinal without a furgeon re-
fiding in it. Poor people cannot afford fending occationally
for a furgeon, to a distant country, at great expences, with
frequent difappointments; the raging elements forbid it; or
perhaps before the relief arrive, the hope of the family is no
more. Too often has the prefent incumbent feen child-bed
women, in particular, fall fad facrifices without relief. It is
too much for this parish, without manufactures, and without
greater
of Tiry.

greater improvements in agriculture, to fupport 3457 inhabi-
tants, if they ſhould be free of other burdens. Yet the peo-
ple have often and cordially united to make up a fmall falary,
according to their abilities, and beſtowed it upon young fur-
geons, who refided now and then amongſt them, confider-
ing it as a temporary appointment. There are now fo many
pious mortifications, fo many public funds raifed upon chari-
table foundations; if, in this refpect, the fituation of this pa
rifh was reprefented and known, Is there any part in Scot-
land in greater need of relief from them? A fund of this
kind, with a farm to refide on, together with what a furgeon
could add to it by his practice, might be an object worth at-
tention to fome gentleman of that profeffion. In the time of
the laft American war, in one twelvemonth 120 youths, and
in this fpring above 100, left this ifland for the fervice of
their country. Does not this merit attention in many ref
pects?
Fuel Coll Ifland abounds in mofs of the beſt quality for
peats, but at fuch diſtances from fome of the farms, that
coals bought at moderate prices, would be far cheaper. One
end of Tiry can, for a few years, inake peats, but in the other
end near 200 families are reduced to the greateſt diſtreſs.
They are robbed of the moſt valuable feafon, in which they
fhould be improving their farms, in ruining, in fleaing them,
2 or 3 inches deep, wherever there is the ſmalleſt mixture of
mofs in the foil. They have now expofed the rocks in many
places. Neceffity finds out many ſhifts. Sometimes in fpring
they gather dried horfe dung; they even burn ſtraw, and
then comes the laſt ſhift, burning the roofs of their houfes
or fome of their furniture.
