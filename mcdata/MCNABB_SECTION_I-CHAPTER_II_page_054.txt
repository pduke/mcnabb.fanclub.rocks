JAMES PINCKNEY MCNABB & EASTER MCNABB- Saga of the 1800's
From Tennessee to Missouri to Texas back to Missouri
Nathaniel Taylor McNabb & Ellender McCubbins McNabb's son, James
Pinckney McNabb, b. Feb. 9, 1814 d. June 28, 1893, was born in
Carter County, Tenn. and died in Marshfield, Webster County,
Missouri. On Nov. 13, 1836 in Bradley Cty. Tenn. James P. married
Easter Flenniken Dearmond b. 1818 d. after the 1880 census. She
no
was born on the Cherokee Indian Nation in Tennessee and was a full
blood Cherokee. She died in Fannin Co. Texas where she had gone
from her home in Webster Cty. Missouri, after 1880, to tend to her
sister who was ill. The family story is that she caught the same
illness, died and was buried in Texas, at an unknown place because
one knows the sister's name, where she lived in Texas, or even
the year that Easter traveled to Texas. However, James P. & Easter
had a son, Nathaniel Armstrong McNabb b. April 2, 1848 d. March 26,
1900, who had moved within 3 miles of Macedonia Cemetery in 1876 &
later, in 1900, was buried in the McNabb family plot in Macedonia
Cemetery, Lascasas (Could be two words) Community, Stephens Cty., Texas,
on Ioni Creek, with space left vacant on one side for his wife,
Rebecca Ann Turner b. Dec. 24, 1857 d. Jan. 29, 1942, but when Rebecca
Ann passed away and the space beside Nathaniel A. McNabb was being
excavated, it was discovered that some person in a coffin had already
been buried there so the grave was immediately reclosed. Thus, two
things. First, Rebecca Ann McNabb, Nathaniel A's wife had to be
buried serveral spaces away from her husband as children were earlier
buried in the intervening spaces and second, it is surmised that
when Easter died, Nathaniel Armstrong McNabb, her son, was notified
and he arranged for his mother's burial in the family plot in Texas,
instead of returning her for burial to Missouri. Inasmuch as Easter's
burial could well have been 15-18 years prior to that of Nathaniel
A. and 55 to 60 years prior to Rebecca Ann's burial, it is quite
possible that no one remembered that Easter was buried in the family
plot. Few even know why (in 1992) Nathaniel A. & Rebecca are not
buried side by side.
Back to the beginning for James Pinckney & Easter McNabb. They had
11 children, 7 boys and 4 girls. They were Albert Houston 1837,
Mathew 1839, James M. 1841, Theodore Washington 1843, Mary E. 1846,
Nathaniel Armstrong 1848, William A. 1850, Rebecca J. 1852, A.J. 1853,
Harriet Ann 1855, Lucretia 1857. James P. as a young man, moved
from his birthplace in Carter Cty., Tennessee to the area that would
become Bradley Cty. Tenn. and thence to the Cherokee Indian Nation
and back to Bradley Cty. Tennessee all before November 1836 when he
married Easter Flenniken. They lived variously from 1837 in McMinn
Cty. Tenn. to Carter Cty. Tenn. to Bradley Cty. Tenn., back to Carter
Cty. Tenn., then in 1851 to Webster Cty., Missouri. They then moved
to Fannin Cty. Texas in 1858, to Cooke Cty. Texas in 1860, back to
Fannin Cty. Texas, until the end of the Civil War, then back to Cooke
Cty. until 1867 when with the help of their eldest son Albert Houston
McNabb, who had come from Missouri to assist them, they returned to
Webster Cty. Missouri. James P. had become blind in 1861-62 so
remained in Webster Cty. Missouri where he accumulated considerable
land prior to his death, on June 28, 1893, which was an unusual
and accidental circumstance, as follows.
After becoming blind in 1861-62 James P. acquired a dog that went
everywhere with him & guided him around the many hazards to be found
on his Missouri farm. On June 25, 1893 James P. had gone some distance
from the house to cut & gather firewood. In the process he became
injured but the dog assisted him sufficently for him to make it back
to the house. Other family members placed the injured man on a pallet
of quilts in the bed of a wagon. Apparently not enough care or skill
was exercised and the wagon turned over on the way to Marshfield, Mo.
& James P. was thrown from the wagon and died of his multiple injuries
on June 28, 1893 & was buried in Timber Ridge Cemetery, Webster Cty.,
Missouri. Following is a Narrative dictated circa 1871-72 by James
Pinckney McNabb to his daughter, Harriet Ann McNabb. â†’
In 1989, Clyde and Cloie McNabb lived on the James Pinckney McNabb
home place, i.e., RR1, Box 1045, Marshfield, Missouri. Clyde McNabb's
father was Harry E. McNabb,
1882, whose father was Albert Houston
McNabb 1837-1923, whose father was James Pinckney McNabb 1814-1893.
