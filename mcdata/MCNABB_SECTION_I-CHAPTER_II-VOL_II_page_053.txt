(I am not thoroughly convinced that Mr. Brennan is
correct in where William came from and when. First,
one cannot find an Oath of Importation in the records,
and it was impossible to own land without an Oath of
Importation or having lived in the country for some
time. Also there is no record that one can find, of
Wm McNabb and several small children having arrived
by ship from anywhere. Further, who ever heard of a

Scottish family in Scotland or
Ireland, naming a child "Baptist"?
Or as I believe it should be
Baptiste--surely he was born
where Wm, his father, was influence
influenced by the French
language.
Died in Washington County, NC/TENN
I believe that Wm McNabb was
born someplace in America, grew
up, married, had children his
wife died & he moved to Augusta
County, Virginia ca 1745,
the children.
