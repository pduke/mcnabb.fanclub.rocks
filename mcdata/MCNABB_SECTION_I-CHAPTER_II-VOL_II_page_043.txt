The account of Wm. McNabb I living, marrying and moving from Glendochart,
Scotland to Virginia ca. 1740's has never seemed valid to me, WCD. If he had
left the children and emmigrated alone, it would have made more sense,
he could have always sent for them or gone back after them. But to take off
to the Colonies with five children ranging in ages from 5 or 6 to 12 or 13
just never seemed to me to be what a prudent Scot would do; especially just
after the death of his wife, Betty Aiken McNabb. I have evidence that there
is more than a possibility that Wm. McNabb I, he of the 1749 land deed in
Augusta Co. Va. came from Dansbury (Now Stroudsburg) Monroe Co. Penn, where
his father Wm. McNabb, Senior, was a blacksmith ca. 1720's. Also in the Lower
Smithfield Township of Dansbury, Delaware Valley, Shawnee, (Bethlehem), and
Wind Gap was Gideon van Aken, who lived in Wind Gap and was probably the
father of the first wife of Wm. McNabb I, Betty Aiken.
Possibly the McNabbs of Dansbury, Penn. (Now Stroudsburg) descend from
James Micknab (McNabb) who sailed from Downes, England, December 8,1651,
aboard the "John & Sarah"--Master John Greene--and landed in Boston, Mass.
before 24 February 1652. James went to work for the Lynn Iron Works. (Note:
70 years later Wm. McNabb in Monroe Co. Penn. was a blacksmith.)
