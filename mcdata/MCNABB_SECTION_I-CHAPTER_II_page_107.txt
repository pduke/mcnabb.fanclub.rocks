Additionally:
Imagine the scene---5 men are seated around a table engaged in
serious discussion. One of them, Landon, turns to David and says,
I know your wife is named Elizabeth Taylor McNabb, however, we
will name our new countyseat, Elizabethton, Carter County, Tenn.,
in honor of my wife, Elizabeth MacLin Carter, AND NOT IN HONOR
OF YOURS.
Just imagine further--here is David McNabb, combat veteran of the
Revol War, experienced Indian fighter-and one is to believe that
he says 'Why sure, Landon, ole boy, anything you say.'
Hell's fire, Landon would not have seen another sunrise.
