We know there were two William McNabbs in 1755. One of them in
Augusta County, Virginia and the other, probably his father, in
the Lower Smithfield Township, Monroe County, Penn. as shown on
A List of Inhabitants Lower Smithfield Township 1750-1755. Also
on this List is Gideon van Aken, whom, I believe, is the father
of Betty Aiken, the first wife of the William McNabb of Augusta
County, Virginia and who should be designated as Junior. The
following three pages contain a list of these inhabitants.
I have included one page from The Indian Forts of the Blue Mountains,
which shows that William McNab, Senior, was still living in the
area in 1758.
Now What?? It seems to me that there is a possibility that James
Micknab (McNabb) of Boston was the father of Wm. McNabb, Senior,
who was the father of Wm. McNabb, Junior; he of the 1749 Augusta Co.,
Virginia grant of land; however, a great deal of research needs to
be done to document the whole story to the extent that we really
know without speculation, the exact history. Perhaps some clan
researcher will proceed with such a project. If so, not only is
there more to be learned from the files of the Monroe County
Historical Association but just across the Delaware River from
Stroudsburg (the new name for Dansbury) is Sussex County, New
Jersey. Their Historical Society is addressed at Box 913, Newton,
NJ 07860.
At one time here in Texas, there was an attractive brunette who, on TV,
in an ad for Western Oilwell Service Company, said "If you don't
have an oil well, then get one. You will love doing business with
Western." Thus if you do not care for my theory of McNabb lineage,
and, its admittedly sparse documentation, then produce a better one.
I will be the first to offer my congratulations. Walter Craig Davidson.
