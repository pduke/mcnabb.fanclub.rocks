Re entry in Revolutionary Army Accounts, Volume I, Page 2, Folio 2.
Babtis McNabb was issued a voucher or specie certificate for some unspe-
cified good or service performed by him during the Revolutionary War in
the amount of 21 pounds, 12 shillings. These vouchers were issued by
the state in lieu of cash to finance the war and were negotiable and interest
bearing. McNabb used his voucher to pay the entry fees on a land grant in
what is now eastern Tennessee. John Armstrong, entry taker for western lands,
received McNabb's voucher and turned it in to the State Comptroller's
Office. Edmund Williams and Landon Carter were auditors for the counties
of Washington and Sullivan (now Tennessee) who originally issued the voucher
to McNabb.
