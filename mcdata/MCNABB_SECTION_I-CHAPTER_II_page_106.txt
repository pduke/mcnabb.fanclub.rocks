familiar with such academic endeavors knows that a thesis at
the master's degree level, is not to be judged as an exhaustive
example of research. Rather, it is to examine the graduate
student's abilities to follow a reasonable scholarly form of
presentation and the content need not indicate research into and
based on original sources. Even though Mr. Merritt received two
years of help from his high school students who 'assisted in
gathering pertinent data.', the results were and are certainly
worthwhile.
Anyway, in January 1989, I called Mr. Merritt to order ten of
the histories so that I could give them to as many libraries. In
the telephone conversation, I mantioned that there was a great deal
more to the naming of Elizabethton, than was immediately apparent
from whatever source he used. Mr. Merritt did not indicate any
interest in the matter, so I just let it drop, as I knew from
years of experience, how defensive many persons become when one
discusses their written efforts. Whether or not this applies to
Mr. Merritt, I have no idea. What I do know is that there is a more
complete account of the naming of Elizabethton, Tenn.,in the
article I have written titled, "Elizabeth Taylor McNabb" than one
is apt to find anywhere else.
