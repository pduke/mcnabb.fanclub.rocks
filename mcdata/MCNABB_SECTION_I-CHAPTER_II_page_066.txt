The causes of fear and alarm increasing our family_
by some of
our neighbors and we remained with them all night; the next morning
my son who had returned home on furlough, went back to see about the
horses we had lot-
ed of 150 or 200 Indians discovered and
pursued him; once in safety, and now panic-struck with fear, all of
us fled
could to a neighbor's house one mile and a quarter dis-
tant. In the house there were huddled together about 60 persons, men,
and children, and very soon the house was surrounged by a bout
women,
180 Indians.
There were not over twelve men and boys in the house that
were able to give the least protection, and these manifesting so much
alarm, caused the women to make an attempt to escape to the woods.
At this time, the Indians, being in a body above the house, we managed
in making our escape, trying to keep the house between us and the
Indians. I was scarcely able to travel, and felt sure of falling
(b. 1852)
a victim to the savages. My dear little daughter, Rebecca, of ten
years, clung to me all the time. I entreated her to leave me and save
herself by keeping up with the rest%3B that my strength was almost gone
and there seemed but little hope of my safety. But the love and.
fidelity of this dear child, was not to be overcome by fear or persuasion.

My son assisted me, and we made our escape. The news came that there
was a company of fifty soldiers in pursuit of the Indians; that they
were in close pursuit. The Indians fled to a high position on the
prairie.
The soldiers advanced on them and an engagement ensued.
The soldiers were driven back a short distance, three of their number.
being killed, and three wounded. The soldiers soon rallied for a
second conflict, advanced and fired on the Indians, who fled, murdering
burning, robbing as they went. My house with its contents was burned
and horses taken about the time of our flight from home, Christmas week
