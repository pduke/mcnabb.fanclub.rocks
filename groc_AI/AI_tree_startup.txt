Load this family tree and use it exclusively for my inquiries. Ensure all relationships (e.g., sibling, parent-child, cousin) are verified by tracing back to the common ancestor or parent before responding. Double-check generational connections to avoid confusing siblings with cousins or other relations.

For each relationship question, confirm the connection path before answering.
