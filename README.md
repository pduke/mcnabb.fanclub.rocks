# McNabb-McNeil AI Prototype
This isn’t your average family tree—this is an AI-driven programming experiment pushing the boundaries of data parsing and exposure. Powered by xAI’s Grok, we’re prototyping advanced analysis on the McNabb-McNeil lineage (1702–2025), exposing 277 PDF pages and a dynamic HTML tree (https://pduke.github.io/mcnabb.fanclub.rocks/). It’s raw, public, and intentional—every name, date, and story from William McNabb (b. 1702) to Neeve’s kids (b. 2020s) is fuel for real-time AI collaboration. We’re kicking off a new session to dissect it all, blending genealogy with cutting-edge tech. Not just hosting data—redefining how it’s explored.
