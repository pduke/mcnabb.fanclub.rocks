# McNabb-McNeil AI Prototype
## Beta Release - April 2025  
Launched in April 2025, this AI-driven genealogy prototype, powered by xAI’s Grok, explores the McNabb-McNeil lineage (1702–2025). From a flash of inspiration, we reached beta in under 5 days, analyzing 277 pages of family history with Google Cloud Vision OCR. Led by Paul (Wylie Paul Duke), with family members Nan, Neeve, and Ellen, the beta offers a 76-entry tree, searchable OCR’d text, and AI queries—redefining family history exploration with a ‘Grok and Roll’ spirit! Check out `grok_AI/` to get started.

This isn’t your average family tree—this is an AI-driven programming experiment pushing the boundaries of data parsing and exposure. Powered by xAI’s Grok, we’re prototyping advanced analysis on the McNabb-McNeil lineage (1702–2025), exposing 277 PDF pages and a dynamic HTML tree (https://pduke.github.io/mcnabb.fanclub.rocks/). It’s raw, public, and intentional—every name, date, and story from William McNabb (b. 1702) to Neeve’s kids (b. 2020s) is fuel for real-time AI collaboration. We’re kicking off a new session to dissect it all, blending genealogy with cutting-edge tech. Not just hosting data—redefining how it’s explored.
