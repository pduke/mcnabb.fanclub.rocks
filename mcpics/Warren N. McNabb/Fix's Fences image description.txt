An old grey bearded cowboy wearing a white shirt, glasses, and white hat and his saddled horse stand by a weathered barbed wire fence at twilight. The sky is filled with low-lying clouds reflecting a deep red hue, casting a dramatic backdrop. The man, dressed in worn work clothes, has just dropped his fence pliers into a well-used steeple sack after a long day of fixing the fence. The scene is calm and serene, with the fading light of the day casting a warm, golden glow over the rolling landscape. The man is beside his loyal horse, their silhouettes framed against the vibrant sky as they look away at the sun, next to the steeple sack.
